<h4>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h4>



<ul>
    <li>First mix all the ground spices (bar the salt) in a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>The next step is to prepare the chicken broth. Roughly chop the onion, heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large saucepan or casserole dish and fry the onion on medium heat for about 5 minutes. If you went for a whole chicken, cut it up into pieces. You can remove the skin off the chicken prior to frying it if you prefer. Add the chicken to the saucepan and fry evenly on each side for about 5 minutes. When the chicken has some colour, pour about 1.3 litre of water in the pan, ensuring the chicken is completely covered. Throw in 3 to 4 bay leaves, 1 heaped teaspoon of salt and 1 heaped tablespoon of the spice mix, bring to boil then cover with the lid and let it simmer on medium heat for 45 minutes. As it cooks, some foam might form at the surface of the water. It’s best to remove this with a spoon so keep checking as it boils. </li>
    <li>While the chicken is cooking, get the vegetables ready. Peel the carrots and the potato and cut into slices of about 1cm. Chop the cauliflower into big chunks and wash. In a frying pan, heat a generous quantity of vegetable oil - about 0.5cm to 1cm deep. Fry all the vegetables in small batches until golden brown on each side. Use paper towel to soak up the oil. </li>
    <li>Thoroughly rinse the rice under running water to remove the starch. Some types of rice might need to soak in water in advance so check the instructions on the pack. </li>
    <li>Once your chicken is cooked, take the pieces out of the broth and put aside. Pour the broth through a sieve into a separate bowl so you keep only the liquid, which you’ll use to cook the maqluba.</li>
    <li>You can now assemble the maqluba. In the same saucepan used to make the broth, lay down the chicken, then the vegetables and finally spread the rice over the vegetables to make three even layers. Sprinkle some more of the spice mix over the rice (a small tablespoon) plus 1.5 heaped teaspoon of salt. Now pour the broth in the pan until it reaches the same level as the rice or 0.5 cm above it (you'll need about 700/800ml of broth). Place a small plate on the rice - this will keep it all in place as it cooks. Don’t mix the ingredients. Bring to boil, then cover and let it simmer on medium heat for about 20 minutes or until there is absolutely no liquid left. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn - once there is no water left, take it off the heat and leave to rest for 10/15 minutes with the lid on.</li>
    <li>The final step is to flip the dish upside down. Open the pan and remove the small plate. Put a large tray or plate over the pan, hold it tight and flip it over so the maqluba transfers to the tray or plate. Your maqluba is ready! </li>
    <li>Note that many people tend to sprinkle a handful of pinenuts (which you can quickly roast in a small frying pan) and parsley over the maqluba when it's ready. </li>
    </ul>
